# Class Overview

## My Introduction

My name is Ross Kaplan, you can call me Ross, Mr. Kaplan, or Professor Kaplan,
whatever you are comfortable with. This is my first time teaching this class.

I graduated from The Cooper Union in 2018 with a bachelors degree and in 2019 with my 
masters degree, both in electrical engineering.  Since then, I've worked at Goldman Sachs
as a software engineer on core infrastructure and later on a trading platform on backend infra.
I currently work at Google on mobile data infrastructure, building software for mobile devices and google servers for synchronizing 
both public and private data.

## Class Introduction

You probably don't need an explanation of computing, since it is now
everywhere.  In short though, computing is just the carrying out of specific
instructions.  This is embedded in a huge range of applications including:

* building a web application
* simulating physical structures
* controlling a nuclear reactor
* automatically controlling drones
* beating humans at chess, go, or league
* precisely landing rockets
* determining protein foldings

You probably won't be able to do those things right after finishing this class,
but you will have the basic foundations to start to understand how they could
be done.

The class will focus very much on practical skills that go into programming.
We will go through multiple languages, each with a different purpose, and we
will practice them by writing interesting programs.  We will also learn some tools
standard to programmers, such as Bash, and time-permitting by the end of the semester,
maybe even a little bit of theory, such as time complexity analysis.

After this class, you will be able to write your own programs, and learn
more languages and tools on your own.  You will understand the elementary
components that comprise most programs.  You will have a greater perspective
on how the digital world around you works as whole.  

This class is also a prerequisite for ECE264, or Data Structures and Algorithms 1, 
which is a gateway to most other CS courses at Cooper, including getting a CS minor.  If you enjoy the 
topics covered in this course, I highly recommend taking that course as well.

## Assignments

Almost every lesson will be supplemented with an assignment.  Each assignment
will either be assigned individually or in small groups.  Assignments make
up a very large portion of you grade so make sure you put in the effort.
All assignments must be submitted one week after they are assigned **before**
the start of class.  My class begins at 6 pm, that means assignments are due at 5:59 pm eastern time.
This is my policy because I know how many students will work on the assignment during class otherwise.  A late assignment receives a zero.

I do however, offer something almost no other professor will offer you: 2 re-submits for the semester.  You will be allowed to make 
revisions for 1 week after receiving the grade for full credit.  This policy is a reflection of the fact
that no code is perfect on the first try.  Some assignments will have automated tests
that can tell you whether your code produces the expected output.  
The grading breakdown for an assignment is roughly as follows:

Correctness: 85%
Style: 15%

What I mean by correctness should be obvious: inputs produce expected
outputs.  Style is slightly more subjective.  Mainly it means your code
is easily readable and well organized.  We will discuss specific expectations
later.

If your program does not run at all, the grade is 0 no matter what.

### Assignment Submission

Assignments in past years by other CS102 faculty have attempted to force students
to submit their assignments via Github education.  I've heard many students have had trouble
with the submission process, so I'm doing what was done when I took CS102 9 years ago with 
Professor Sable: email submissions.  It's certainly not my first choice, but I want everyone
to enjoy the course and source material, even if it's more effort for me.  Please send the email with subject: "CS102 <first name> <last name> Assignment #X" 
to ross.kaplan@cooper.edu.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will be used as a way for me to gauge the understanding of the class,
so it is important that everyone try their best.  It is not my way of punishing
you for not understanding.  

## Attendance

Attendance is not mandatory, but I highly suggest it.  If you don't want to
attend classes, you may be better off watching videos and reading tutorials
online rather than taking this class.  I'm not kidding!  That is still a really
good way to learn computer science.  Some great online lectures include
*CS50* from Stanford and *The Missing Semester* from MIT.

The benefits you get from actually attending class are:

* live interaction with your peer group, a shared experience.
* personalized teaching; and
* motivation to actually pay attention and learn.

I will still expect you take the quizzes however, regardless of if you attend
the full lecture or not.  If you have extenuating circumstances, please communicate 
with me, I am very flexible.  However, without communicating, missing the quiz will result in a 0.  

## Office Hours

I will hold office hours right after class.  Office hours a great time to ask in-depth questions that couldn't normally
be asked in class due to time constraints.  This includes help with
assignments and help fixing your programs.  I am also available for personal appointments outside of business hours, just
message me to set one up.  Lastly, I'm happy to help by email as well!

## Academic Honesty

You can use look up small snippets of code online, but it is never appropriate
to copy code verbatim without understanding it.  If you copy entire assignments
or sizable chunks from the internet or classmates, that is cheating.  You can
certainly ask for advice, however.  If you do end up copying a small amount
of code from a classmate or online source, I ask that you:

1. Type it out manually and think about what you are writing rather than just
   copy pasting the whole thing.
2. Attribute the source in a comment.

The above does not apply to LLM-generated code.  Do not use chatgpt, bard, or any 
other AI-based code tools that generate code for you.  Even cited, LLM code generation
is strictly off-limits.

If I find you are cheating on an assignment you will receive zero credit, and
I am obligated to report the incident.

If you have *any* questions about the academic honesty policies of this course, please
ask me.  

## Topics

This course is not designed to give you a particularly deep introduction into
any field of computer science, but a broad overview of many parts.  We begin
with a very "low level" language, C which will help you understand some of the
inner workings of a computer.  We will then briefly touch on C++ to give you an
introduction to "object oriented programming".  Then we will move onto Python,
a high level language that you can use for fast prototyping.  Time permitting, we 
will then spend some time with SQL (Structured Query Language) which is the de-facto
language for interfacing with databases and possibly cover some web development.

If you want to delve into these subjects in a deeper way, Cooper Union offers these
courses through the Electrical Engineering department:

* Hardware: Electronics, Digital Logic Design, Computer Architecture
* Sensors: Digital Signal Processing, Control Theory
* Networking: Computer Networking, Communication Theory
* Low level programming: Operating Systems, Compilers, Computer Security
* Advanced Algorithms: Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning
* Databases, SQL: Databases
* Web Development: Large Software Projects

If any of these things interest you, speak to me, or some member of the
Electrical Engineering faculty as soon as possible and we can help you
figure out if the classes are right for you and what pre-requisites you may
need.

## Strategies for Learning

The same as any other skill, the best way to learn coding is to do it.  If you
simply write code frequently with the intention of making something interesting
or useful, you will learn to code.  Whenever you write code, you should always
be thinking of how to make it better.  For many problems you encounter, you
should always feel comfortable searching for the solution on the internet.
One very valuable thing to learn is how to search for the solution, and how
to describe the problem in a way that is can be easily searched.  We will work
on building coding vocabulary throughout the class.

## Questions

I will be asking all of you for a steady stream of feedback to make sure that
my teaching is working for you.  I come from a place of a decent amount of
experience, so it can be difficult for me to realize when something is not
obvious, or that some students might be lacking some requisite knowledge.

If you find something confusing, please call me out immediately as it is
likely that other students feel the same.  This class is for beginners, not
people who already have programming experience.  Therefore, no question
you could possibly ask that is too basic for me to answer.  If you have any
question during class just raise your hand.  If you are to shy for that,
feel free to message me privately.

If you have questions outside of contact hours, just send me an email at
ross.kaplan@cooper.edu.
