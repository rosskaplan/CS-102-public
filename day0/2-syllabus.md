# Syllabus

## Summary

This course is designed to teach you practical programming skills.  Everything
you learn here will be widely applicable to academic and industrial work.

After taking this course, you will
* Be capable of using a terminal
* Be capable of using Bash and writing scripts
* Be capable of writing C code
* Be capable of writing Python code
* Be prepared for future courses that require programming
* Be a more self sufficient programmer

## Lessons

Some of these will take multiple classes to fully cover.  Assignments may follow lessons or the completion of an entire topic.  

The course specifically requires covering linux and C, though there are more topics we will cover if time permits.  Once the C and python requirements are covered, we can spend a few weeks on other popular technologies worth having a fundamental understanding of.

## Academic Honesty

If you use code from another source (a website, a book, or another student) you
must cite it with a comment.  If you do not cite it, you will receive zero
credit for that assignment.  You should never copy another student's code
directly.  You may ask for advice or single-line snippets but if I find that
significant portions of your assignment have been copied from another student,
you will receive a zero, and I will be obligated to report it.  

The above does not apply to LLM-generated code.  Do not use chatgpt, bard, or any 
other AI-based code tools that generate code for you.  Even cited, LLM code generation
is strictly off-limits.

If you have *any* questions about the academic honesty policies of this course, please
