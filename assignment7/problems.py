# Create a comment with your name

# Create a string called 'name' which stores your name

# Print the 'name' variable

# Create a variable storing an integer

# Create a variable storing a floating point number

# This line creates a string of 1000000 random letters
rs = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase, k=1000001))
# Print whether your first name (lowercase) appears in the string

# Print the first letter, last letter, and middle letter

# This line creates a string of some random words
rw = ''.join(random.choices(list(string.ascii_lowercase) + [' '], k=1000))
# Print the number of words (a word being characters surrounded by spaces)

# This is a string to be formatted
sentence = '{greeting}, my name is {name}'
# Print the sentence formatted with your choice of greeting and your name

# Create a variable storing a tuple of your three favorite numbers

# Assign those three numbers to variables 'a', 'b', and 'c' in one line

# Create a variable storing None

# Create a variable, lst, storing a list of the numbers 0-1000 (inclusive)

# Print the sum and average of the list

# Create a variable, ascii_low, storing a **set** of all lowercase ascii characters

# Create a varaible, ascii_all, storing a **set** of all ascii characters

# Create a variable, ascii_hi, storing the set different between ascii_all and
# ascii_low, i.e. (ascii_all - ascii_low)

# Create a dictionary with one key, your first name that maps to one value,
# your last name

# Alter the dictionary to make your last name all caps

# Here is a nested structure
d = {'hello': [[{'cory': 'nezin'}, {'CORY': ['N', 'E', 'Z', 'I', 'N']}]]}
# Change the 'Z' from the list ['N', 'E', 'Z', 'I', 'N'] inside to a 'z'

# Use a for loop to print numbers 1 through 10 (inclusive)

# Use a for loop to create a list of the first 10 cubes (0 through 9, cubed)

# Now use a list comprehension to do the same

# Write a function 'unique' which takes a list and checks if each element is
# unique, meaning there are no duplicates inside the list.
