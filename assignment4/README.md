# Assignment-4-Pointers-And-Arrays

Please fill in the code for all programs here.  I recommend the following order
(ranked from least difficult to most)

1. `transform`
2. `lower`
3. `strip`
4. `palindrome`
5. `conway`

To run your code, I am going to run the `make` command which follows the
instructions in `Makefile`.  You can do the same to make sure it looks okay
before sending it to me.

Please note: conway is not in the `test` make target.  This is because it is extra credit!
