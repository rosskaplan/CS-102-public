Please fill in the code for all programs here.  I recommend the following order
(ranked from least difficult to most)

1. `median.c`
2. `pythagorean.c`
3. `mypow.c`
4. `uparrow.c`
5. `collatz.c`

To run your code, I am going to run the `make` command which follows the
instructions in `Makefile`.  You can do the same to make sure it looks okay
before sending it to me.
